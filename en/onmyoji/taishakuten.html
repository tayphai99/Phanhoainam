			Golden Lotus<br />
			[Debuff, Mark] Allows Taishakuten to gain control of a turn. Golden Lotus negates all controlling effects inflicted by a single skill at the cost of 1 turn of its duration. When Taishakuten takes lethal damage, Golden Lotus is removed, blocking the damage and recovering his HP to 5% of his max HP. If it's inflicted on a monster, when the monster takes damage, it additionally inflicts damage equal to 40% of the damage dealt as true damage. The true damage inflicted won't trigger Taishakuten's Soul—set effects. The effect lasts until the battle ends. Taishakuten can only inflict Golden Lotus on up to 1 enemy and himself is immune to this effect.
