			Onikiri is even more tenacious after being reforged. Gains 20% damage reduction indefinitely. When taking a normal attack, if he's not <span class="onmyoji-c2">Unable to Take Actions</span>, has a 30% chance of parrying the attack, which prevents him from taking damage and raises his Move Bar by 10%.<br />
			Active skill: Enters <span class="onmyoji-c1">Blade of the Mind</span> state and inflicts <span class="onmyoji-c1">Shadow Cut</span> on 1 enemy. Then casts <span class="onmyoji-c2">Shadowy Double</span>.

			<ul>
				<li>Lv.2: Increases the indefinite damage reduction rate to 30%.</li>
				<li>Lv.3: Increases the base chance of parrying to 40%.</li>
				<li>Lv.4: Each parry triggered increases his damage by 20%. Stacks up to 5 times.</li>
				<li>Lv.5: When taking lethal damage, recovers his HP to 30% of his max HP, and raises his Crit RES by 100% and his SPD by 100 for 1 turn. Triggers only once each round.</li>

			<p class="onmyoji-box-c1">
			Blade of the Mind<br />
			[General, Mark] Grants immunity to controlling effects. Parry chance is doubled. Inflicts Silence on the attacker for 1 turn when a parry is triggered. Counter-attack and Call to Arms won't be triggered for its duration. At the start of his turn, if the Shadow Cut on the enemy is removed, Blade of the Mind is also removed.
			</p>
			<p class="onmyoji-box-c1">
			Shadow Cut<br />
			[Genera|, Mark] Locked on by the Shadowy Double. Visible to allies only. Can be removed when the enemy with Shadow Cut uses normal attack on Onikiri Reforged or when Onikiri Reforged takes 5 normal attacks.
			</p>
			<p class="onmyoji-box-c2">
			Effective Exclusively<br />
			If multiple shikigami of the same name are in your lineup, only one of those shikigami's skills will be effective.
			</p>
			<p class="onmyoji-box-c2">
			Unable to Take Actions<br />
			Units that are Banished or inflicted with controlling effects, including Freeze, Sleep, Daze, Morph, Deep Freeze, Shadowbound, and Frostbound are unable to take actions.
			</p>
			
			<p class="onmyoji-box-c2">
			Shadowy Double<br />
			Inherits all the current stats of Onikiri Reforged. At the start of a turn, the double disappears if the Shadow Cut mark on the enemy is removed. Otherwise, the double launches the same attack as Onikiri Reforged when he attacks on his turn against the target with the Shadow Cut mark.

			Raises his blade high and conjures up an illusory demon warrior to strike the target, dealing damage equal to 263% of his ATK. Inflicts <span class="onmyoji-c1">Endangered</span> lasting 2 turns on them if they're not <span class="onmyoji-c1">Endangered</span>.
			</p>

				<li>Lv.3: Increases damage to 289%.</li>
				<li>Lv.4: Increases damage to 302%.</li>

			<p class="onmyoji-box-c1">
			Endangered<br />
			[Debuff, Mark] Reduces healing received by 75%, slows SPD by 20, and reduces DEF by 20%. The next damage dealt by Onikiri Reforged or the Shadowy Double ignores shields, cannot be shared, and doesn't trigger the affected unit's Soul effects or passive skills before removing the mark.
