			Using the skill turns himself into <span class="onmyoji-c2">The Serpent Lord</span>, storing 6% of the starting ATK of all other shikigami allies in 1 Ame-no-Habakiri to serve as the energy required to break the seal of Ame-no-Habakiri. When he's KO'd, all stored ATK will be returned to its respective owners. If the skill is used in succession, its orb cost increases by 1 orb each time.
